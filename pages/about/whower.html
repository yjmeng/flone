    Naomi Mwaura Flone Founding Director grew up watching her uncles work as public vehicle drivers, conductors and cleaners. Naomi did not see the matatu industry as a lost cause but as a misunderstood and neglected industry. At one time, she was physically assaulted by public vehicle conductors. These contrasting experiences demonstrated the need for an initiative that would improve the lives of public transport operators, create safer spaces for women, and change the matatu industry for the better.

    Today, Flone Initiative has grown in strength and impact, gaining visibility, authority and legitimacy as an agent of positive change within the transportation industry.
